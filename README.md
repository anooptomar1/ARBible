# HCCP Hackathon 2017: ARBible

This is a project based on [Apple's interactive ARKit example project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/handling_3d_interaction_and_ui_controls_in_augmented_reality). We changed out the built-in models for some Bible-themed ones, and added some smarts around initial scaling of large models and the ability to pinch to scale models.
